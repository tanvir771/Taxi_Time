<p>Taxi Time is a game developed using SFML and C++ that aims to enhance my understanding of project organization and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The game features a scrolling road background to simulate the movement of a taxi, providing an engaging gameplay experience. This project is currently in progress, and I'm focused on refining its structure and functionality as I develop it further.</p>
